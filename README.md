# Flask API project
This project demonstrates the development of a RESTful API using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. The API provides endpoints for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database.

# Features
Implements CRUD operations for managing resources.
Uses Flask to create and manage API endpoints.
Establishes a connection to a database for persistent storage.
Allows testing of API endpoints using Postman.
# Requirements
Python 3.x
Flask
MySQL or any other relational database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL)
Postman (for testing API endpoints)

This project serves as a starting point for building more complex web applications or APIs using Flask. Feel free to explore the codebase, make improvements, or add new features as needed.
